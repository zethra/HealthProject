                    <strong>Focus Question:</strong><br>
                    2.2.12.A.3: How can technology play a role in supporting someone who is grieving?
                </p>

                <p>
                    To answer this question I explored phone apps that are meant to help with grieving.

                    <strong>Personal Connection:</strong><br>
                    I feel connected to this topic because I have experienced grief and bereavement in my life, as
                    probably everyone has.
                    I lost my grandmother and my dog when I was 14. I lost my step-grandfather when I was 15. I also
                    lost a good family friend, about my parents' age, when I was 16.

                    The author of the artifacts chosen for this topic are David Ridgeway, Joe Prainito, and Jocelyn

                <p>
                    Here are three different phone apps with the purpose of helping people who are grieving.
                </p>

                <p>

                    At this Mayo Clinic web site you can get an app called “Cope with Bereavement” and another called
                    “Grief Support”:
                    <a href="http://mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/medical-services/employee-assistance/resource-directory/grief">Mayo
                        Clinic Apps</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    At this web site you can get an app called “Help for the Grieving”:
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.itakeoffthemask.grief&hl=en">Google Store
                        App</a><br>
                </p>

                <hr/>

                <p>
                    <strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                    “Cope with Bereavement” uses hypnotherapy. David Ridgeway is a certified hypnotherapist who is a
                    part of this app. It runs on Android and Blackberry devices. The description starts out with:<br>
                    <span class="indented">“Have you recently lost a loved one? Finding it difficult to
                    move on? Why not give hypnotherapy a try?”</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Grief Support” says it provides support for people who are not comfortable going to a support
                    group.
                    The description of this app includes:<br>
                    <span class="indented">“Grief Counsellor, Pastor, and Author Joe Prainito now offers
                    the very first grief support experience right here on your iPhone.”</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since these two apps are on the Mayo Clinic’s site, I figure they would have been researched and
                    considered reputable, before being endorsed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Help for the Grieving” includes self-help guides and poems and verses that give hope and comfort.
                    It is by Jocelyn Soriano who is an author of inspirational and self-help books and a blog. Out of
                    110 reviews, the “Help for the Grieving” app got 72 5-star and 16 4-star reviews. That’s very good.
                </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Analysis:</strong><br>
                I think that for many people, grieving is a private thing. They don’t necessarily want to talk about it.
                For this reason, apps like this could be very useful and helpful. I think that during the bargaining and
                depression stages of grief in particular is when people would be most likely to use an app like these,
                to help them come out of the sadness and move to acceptance. The apps might also help the person start
                to feel more comfortable with reaching out to a friend or counsellor in person.

                <strong>Discussion Questions:</strong><br>
                Question 1: Do you think you would feel comfortable or uncomfortable talking about your grief, and
                why?<br>
                Question 2: What is your reaction to there being this type of app?
