                    <strong>Focus Question:</strong><br>
                    2.3.12.C.3: Predict the societal impact of the intergroup
                    conflict that results when greedy and dishonest politicians get into power and serve
                    themselves rather than the people.
                </p>

                <p>

                    To answer this question I found a song that expresses the feeling of this intergroup conflict very
                    well.

                    <strong>Personal Connection:</strong><br>
                    I feel a particular connection to this topic because I am now of voting age. I have started paying
                    attention to the presidential political process and it all seems like a circus. I think many other
                    people feel this way too, especially new young voters. Also, since many people my age like rock and
                    roll,
                    this Who song really connects.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                    I picked this song because it represents my feelings about the
                    conflicts going on in our political system today. The politicians just play us all for fools.
                    The first verse starts out like this:<br>
                    <span class="indented">We'll be fighting in the streets</span><br>
                    <span class="indented">With our children at our feet</span><br>
                    <span class="indented">And the morals that they worship will be gone</span><br>
                    <span class="indented">And the men who spurred us on</span><br>
                    <span class="indented">Sit in judgement of all wrong</span><br>
                    <span class="indented">They decide and the shotgun sings the song</span><br>
                    It is describing how people are rebelling against those in power. But those in power are the
                    ones who made things bad for the people fighting. They set up the rules, and then punish those
                    who are rebelling.<br>
                    The song goes on with different descriptions of how things might change with new leaders, like
                    with a new constitution or a new revolution or a new war or new slogans. But behind all that,
                    things are actually just the same.<br>
                    <span class="indented">There's nothing in the streets</span><br>
                    <span class="indented">Looks any different to me</span><br>
                    They are hoping they “don’t get fooled again” with the new boss. The song ends with:<br>
                    <span class="indented">Meet the new boss</span><br>
                    <span class="indented">Same as the old boss</span>
                </p>

                <strong>Analysis:</strong><br>
                As long as there are politicians who are looking out for themselves
                rather than really trying to do good for the people and the country, this conflict will persist.
                The societal impact on the people in the society is that they feel deceived and distrusting.
                When people are angry and discouraged by the way their country is run and how they are treated,
                then it can be very hard for them to think positively, be constructive, and want to do good things
                themselves. Sometimes it’s just easier to believe what they’re saying and think they’re looking
                out for everyone’s best interests. But I do believe that some politicians are good people and
                really are trying. The solution is for people to “not get fooled again” when they are voting.
                This is easier said than done.

                <strong>Discussion Questions:</strong><br>
                Question 1: Do you think that there is an intergroup conflict between politicians in our country
                and the people of our country? Why or why not?<br>
                Question 2: How can we keep from getting fooled by the people running for office in our country?
