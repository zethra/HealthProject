                        <strong>Welcome to my Senior Health Portfolio.</strong>
                        The purpose of this portfolio is to summarize the topics covered in my senior health class:
                        conflict, grief, addiction, and image disorders. For each of these four topics, I chose an
                        artifact and did some research, and then I made some conclusions and personal
                        connections.
                    </p>

                    <p> Click on "The Four Units" in the navigation bar above to get to the four artifact entry points 
                        and then click on the artifact you want to read about.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Click on "Conclusion" to read about my description of the connection between the four
                        senior health topics and to read the summary of my personal connection to this project.

                        The four topics of the senior health project are conflict, grief, addiction, and image
			disorders.  These topics have to do with mental health more than physical health. We
			learned about mostly physical health in the earlier school years.  I think these are difficult 
			topics to talk about but they are important.  I think that if a person experiences conflicts in
			their life that they feel they can't resolve or can't get out of, then they might turn inward and
			use negative things to bury the pain.  Also with grief, a person might try drugs or alcohol or other
			self-destructive things to deal with the pain.  Addiction and image disorders are things that end up
			causing the person a lot of harm.  But if they had been able to resolve the original conflict or get
			the support they needed to deal with their grief, then maybe the addiction or image disorder would not
			have happened.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The essential question of this course/project is: How can I respond to conflict and/or change in a 
			healthy way?<br>
			My conflict topic artifact aligns to this question in a different way than the others.  
			The intergroup conflict topic I chose has the lesson in it to "not get fooled again" by the other group.  
			For the other three types of conflicts, this same lesson could be applied.  Open your eyes to see what's 
			really happening that is causing the conflict.  Don't fool yourself, don't get fooled by another person, 
			don't get fooled by a group that you might feel is in conflict with you.  Try to find the truth and then 
			act based on that.
			The grief, addiction, and image disorder topic artifacts all have something to do with self-help or getting 
			help for significant problems you might have in your life.  Doing the research on these three topics made 
			me more aware of the many healthy ways of responding to conflicts or other difficulties in my life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have a stronger personal connection to the grief topic than the others, since I lost several people
			close to me and my family dog since I have been in high school.  The addiction and image disorder topics
			I also have a significant personal connection to, since I have known people with both of these problems.
			I have not lived the problems myself, but I have seen them pretty closely in a way that gave me a stronger
			awareness of how they effect the people.  I think my connection to the conflict topic is the lowest.
			I do have my own intrapersonal conflicts, but they don't weigh me down.  I usually resolve interpersonal 
			conflicts before they get bad.  The intergroup conflict is what I found most interesting to use for my 
			conflict topic because it's something that impacts all of us.
