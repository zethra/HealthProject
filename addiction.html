                    <strong>Focus Question:</strong><br>
                    2.2.12.E.1: What options does a family have in seeking treatment for their
                    loved one who is struggling with addiction?
		</p>

		<p>
                    To answer this question I researched different services for helping with addiction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Personal Connection:</strong><br>
                    Thankfully, I have not had anyone in my family with an addiction problem.
                    However, there was a family friend that we found out had a bad problem with prescription pain
                    killers. I remember times when I could tell that she was not acting normal or rational.

                    <strong>Artifact:</strong><br>
                    The author of the artifact chosen for this topic is the "Live and Work Well" web site.<br>
                    I researched and compared/contrasted health services for addiction, such as health insurance
                    plans, rehab facilities, various types of counseling programs, self-help kits. I did this by
                    going to the web site that I have access to through my parents’ medical insurance plan:
                    <a href="http://www.liveandworkwell.com" target="_blank">Live and Work Well</a><br>
                    Even without a login to the site, you can read about interesting topics that are listed
                    on the right.
                </p>

                <hr/>

                <p>
                    <strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                    My parents’ health insurance provides a variety of services for addition. I browsed the
                    web site www.liveandworkwell.com and I found an amazing amount of information and help
                    about different types of addictions. There are self-help guides in case you want to figure
                    out if you or someone you know has a serious problem or if you want to try working things
                    out on your own. There are links to several self-help programs including: a tobacco
                    cessation plan, a personal empowerment program called “Recognizing At-Risk Drinking and
                    Drug Use”, and information about eight different smartphone apps for substance use disorder
                    treatment and recovery.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The web site also has sections that provide comprehensive information and further resources
                    for the topics of: alcoholism, children and addiction, drug use, tobacco, and other addictions.
                    There is information on how to contact helpful organizations like Al-Anon, Alateen, AA, Nar-Anon,
                    and Gam-Anon. There is even a phone number to call to get confidential help, 24/7.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I looked up what kinds of treatments are covered by the insurance, I found both out-patient
                    and in-patient treatments. Out-patient treatments could be at a counsellor’s or doctor’s office
                    or at a hospital. In-patient treatments could be at a hospital or a residential treatment
                    facility.

                <strong>Analysis:</strong><br>
                There are different approaches to helping people with addictions. First, you need to
                identify if there is an addiction. There are self-help ways of figuring this out, and
                there are also medical tests that can help determine if you’re addicted. Once you figure
                out if you or your loved one is addicted to something, then you/they can try self-help
                ways of quitting, or can reach out to group-help organizations or other therapy. Groups
                like AA or Nar-Anon can be very effective at helping people. Some people don’t want to
                deal with their problems in a group, so the self-help tools or individual therapy might
                be better for them. But in my opinion, having the help and support of other people who
                are struggling with the same thing can be a very powerful and positive influence. You
                might discover that other people have similar issues in their lives that led them to want
                to drink or do drugs, and this could give you new insights on dealing with your own
                addiction.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many addictions involve having to get over the body’s physical addition, before the person
                can have any hope of staying away from the substance they’re addicted to. It is often
                necessary for the addict to get medical help. A simple example is “the patch” for helping
                to get off of nicotine. However, for an alcoholic or a narcotics addict to stop taking
                their drug, the body will go through a painful withdrawal. Since there is a range of
                choices in medical treatments, from regular office visits, to all-day treatment centers,
                to residential live-in treatment centers, I think that the necessary level of treatment
                will depend on how bad the addict’s situation is.

                <strong>Discussion Questions:</strong><br>
                Question 1: Do you know anyone who is addicted to something? What are they addicted to?<br>
                Question 2: Do you think it’s harder to stop using something you are addicted to if it is a
                socially acceptable thing? Why or why not?
