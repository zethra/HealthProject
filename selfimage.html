                    <strong>Focus Question:</strong><br>
                    2.1.12.C.1: After evaluating risk factors, how susceptible is a person to having an
                    eating disorder?
                </p>

                <p>
                    To answer this question I found interviews with counsellors that included the professional
                    insights they have about risk factors and susceptibility.

                    <strong>Personal Connection:</strong><br>
                    I feel connected to this topic because my cousin has an eating disorder. She has struggled
                    with anorexia for over 5 years.

                    Sari Fine Shepphird, PhD, is a clinical psychologist and eating disorder specialist.
                    One of the questions she was asked was specifically about the warning signs for eating
                    disorders and also what underlying issues an eating disorder may often be a symptom of.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                    Some common warning signs for eating disorders are:<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>the person avoids eating with others;</p></li>
                    <li><p>starts to restrict the types of foods they eat as well as the quantity;</p></li>
                    <li><p>becomes secretive about their eating;</p></li>
                    <li><p>skips meals;</p></li>
                    <li><p>makes frequent trips to the bathroom after meals;</p></li>
                    <li><p>starts to exercise excessively.</p></li>
                </ul>


                <p>
                    Some more subtle warning signs for eating disorders are:<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>the person starts to dress in very baggy clothes;</p></li>
                    <li><p>shows great concern about weight gain and makes a lot of weight-related comments;</p></li>
                    <li><p>loses or gains a significant amount of weight;</p></li>
                    <li><p>develops perfectionistic tendencies;</p></li>
                    <li><p>shows signs of low self-esteem;</p></li>
                    <li><p>is embarrassed or ashamed after eating.</p></li>
                </ul>


                <p>
                    There are various risk factors for eating disorders:<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Both doctors in the interviews agree that in our culture, the ideal body is
                        basically unattainable, unless you spend all your time at it or have plastic surgery.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Young women are exposed to many media and role models who fuel social pressure to be
                        thin.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A family preoccupation with weight, food, and appearance can become internalized.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Children should not be given restricted diets. Natural hunger and fullness cues can be
                        affected
                        if children are made to feel guilty for what they eat.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Older women also face unrealistic pressures about their image and appearance. Challenges
                        such as divorce, childbirth, and menopause are events that can trigger anorexia at a later
                        age.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Male athletes have a higher reported rate of eating disorders, partly due to the belief that
                        weight loss is necessary for peak performance.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Homosexual and bisexual males also have a higher rate of anorexia.</p></li>
                </ul>

                    More risk factors for eating disorders:<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>People with eating disorders often report having been teased about their bodies or appearance
                        .</p></li>
                    <li><p>People with eating disorders often are experiencing underlying emotional distress,
                        relationship
                        or psychological conflicts, past trauma, or difficult life transitions.</p></li>
                    <li><p>For some people, anorexia is a distraction from other painful feeling or life events they
                        feel
                        they can't manage.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Analysis:</strong><br>
                    Based on the risk factors that the doctors in the two interviews talk about, I think it would
                    be very difficult to predict how susceptible a person is to having an eating disorder. I think
                    that most of us are exposed to some level of the pressures that are described, and many of us
                    are also dealing with problems in our lives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Maybe the image pressures would have to be very extreme. Maybe with teasing or other put downs
                    put on top of the image pressures, and with very difficult conflicts and painful situations in
                    the person's life, an eating disorder is like their breaking point. There are differences in
                    how resilient different people are. Maybe that is a key aspect of how susceptible a person is
                    to having an eating disorder.
                </p>

                    <strong>Discussion Questions:</strong><br>
                    Question 1: Do you think that you are more critical of how you look than how you think other
                    people look? Why or why not?<br>
                    Question 2: What pressures do you notice around you that say you should be thin or look a
                    certain way?
